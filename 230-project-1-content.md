## 4. Story
Following the widespread destruction of America from a third world war, several countries of ex-united states formed along cultural lines due to their lack of support for the failing federal government. Six factions now exist, made up of the Pacific States, The Mid-Western Alliance, Texas, New England, The Dixie States, and the United States of America. With the states and international institutions being weaker than ever before, war between ex-American countries is becoming frequent in order to grow more powerful and project that power on the others. Every country wants to extend their ideologies to the rest of the states, and reform their former empire along their own cultural values. You - the player - will lead your chosen nation to victory, and reunite America under your banner.

## 5. Aesthetics
*Post-America: Conquest* will have a simple colored political map, showing the territory owned by each nation. Menus will have gritty, wood-like textures which show the properties of the targeted nation.
Most sounds present in the game will be used for input feedback to the user, such as clicking on an interface or moving troops to another province.

## 6. Gameplay
Players will be able to
  *Build factories and other buildings
  *Trade or ally with other nations
  *Form defensive or offensive coalitions against other bigger and stronger nations

The player will use a keyboard and mouse to play the game. Arrow keys will be used to translate the camera, as will the mouse. Mouse buttons will be used for most navigation.

A manual will be provided for playing the game for newcomers, which will describe game mechanics and basic concepts of foreign policy.

In order to beat the game, the player will need to have an understanding of micromanagement and foreign policy in order to restore America to its former might. Every country will have its own specific attributes for the player to learn or exploit.
